The article highlights several key principles for creating impactful and understandable data visualizations:

Clarity of Visual Designs: Midway discusses the use of various graphical representations, such as bar plots, histograms, and scatterplots, to effectively convey different types of data. For instance, histograms are particularly useful for showing distributions, while scatterplots are excellent for illustrating relationships between variables.
Importance of Showing Data: It is often recommended to include raw data in the visualizations whenever possible. This practice helps provide context and enhances the trustworthiness of the graphical representation.
Use of Color: The article points out the strategic use of color in visualizations, which can significantly impact the viewer's understanding and retention of the information. Color not only helps in distinguishing data elements but also enhances the memorability of the visualization.
Data and Model Distinction: It's crucial to distinguish between raw data and the models used for inferential statistics when presenting visual information. This helps in setting the right expectations and interpretations by the audience.
Choice of Geometry: The selection of appropriate geometric forms (like box plots or violin plots) to represent data is vital. Each geometry has its strengths in showcasing certain types of data insights, such as distributions or relationships.
