The review covers various methodologies and techniques that have been developed to visualize uncertainty. It explains that visualizing uncertainty involves not only displaying uncertainty inherent in the data but also understanding the uncertainty introduced during the visualization process itselfâ€”such as errors that can occur as data is processed through different stages of a visualization pipeline.

Key challenges in uncertainty visualization are highlighted, including the need for additional dimensions in displays which are often already maximized, making it difficult to represent uncertainty effectively without cluttering the visual space. Techniques like using color, animation, or auxiliary plots are discussed as ways to represent uncertainty without overwhelming the primary data presentation.
